## Add your desired links to the `config.wb` file and watch it work, blazingly fast ðŸ˜Ž

When you first open the program, there will be no `config.wb` file. The program creates a new file in the current directory and exits.

Once the file is created, run the program again and it should open, blazingly fast ðŸ˜Ž

```ini
# config.wb - file generated by webbox on first launch
[LINKS]
https://github.com/ionutrogojan/webbox

```

After the initial execution, open `config.wb` and paste your links like so:

```ini
[LINKS]
https://github.com/ionutrogojan/webbox
https://www.rust-lang.org/
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/blazingly
```

`!important` - do not add spaces, empty lines or remove `[LINKS]`. You will break the program otherwise.

`Added support for comments` - use `#` at the beginning of the line.

## I can't find my `config.wb` file! Where is it?

```ini
[Linux]

You will find the config.wb file inside the "HOME" directory

[Windows]

You will find config.wb inside the same directory as the .exe file

[MacOs]

You will find the config.wb file inside the "HOME" directory
```
