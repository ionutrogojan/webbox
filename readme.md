## Add your desired links to the `config.wb` file and watch it work, blazingly fast ðŸ˜Ž

When your first open the program, there will be no `config.wb` file. The program creates a new file in the current directory and exits.

Once the file is created, run the program again and it should open, blazingly fast ðŸ˜Ž

```ini
# config.wb - file generated by webbox on first launch
